<h1>The best comic book movies according to Shaurya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 comic book movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>
Amazing cinematography, direction and story. The ending was spectacular and the pacing was perfect.<br />
It's so rewatchable and it got me so hyped for Endgame.
</p>
<h3>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - Ultimate Edition</h3>
<p>
Now, don't get me wrong. The BvS theatrical cut is pretty bad. However, the additional 30 minutes make<br />
a real difference. We get so much more depth and it is genuinely the best DCEU film (ZSJL comes close).<br />
The CGI and cinematography are beautiful. Ben Affleck was an oustanding Batman and Gal Gadot portrayed<br />
Wonder Woman flawlessly. The only problem I had was the pacing. However, it doesn't outperform Infinity<br />
War, in my opinion.
</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>
Without a doubt the greatest animated film of all time, this sequel builds upon the strengths of its<br/>
predecessor. The animation is on point, with some amazing scenes, especially the Spider-Verse vs Miles<br />
scene. Metro Boomin made an amazing soundtrack and I could listen to it again and again.
